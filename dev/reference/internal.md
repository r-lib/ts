# Utility functions for ts language implementations (internal)

These functions are for packages implementing new parsers based on the
ts package. It is very unlikely that you will need to call these
functions directly.

## Usage

``` r
ts_collapse(
  s,
  sep = ", ",
  sep2 = sub("^,", "", last),
  last = ", and ",
  trunc = Inf,
  width = Inf,
  ellipsis = "...",
  style = c("both-ends", "head")
)

ts_cnd(..., class = NULL, call = ts_caller_env(), .envir = parent.frame())

ts_caller_arg(arg)

as_ts_caller_arg(x)

# S3 method for class 'ts_caller_arg'
as.character(x, ...)

ts_caller_env(n = 1)

ts_check_named_arg(arg, frame = -1)

ts_parse_error_cnd(tree, text, call = ts_caller_env())
```

## Arguments

- s:

  For `ts_collapse()` a character vector to collapse.

- sep:

  Separator string for most elements.

- sep2:

  Separator string for two elements.

- last:

  Separator string before the last element.

- trunc:

  Integer, maximum number of elements to show before truncation.

- width:

  Integer, maximum display width of the collapsed string. If the
  collapsed string exceeds this width, it will be truncated with
  `ellipsis`.

- ellipsis:

  String to indicate truncation.

- style:

  Character, the collapsing style to use. Possible values are
  `"both-ends"` (the default), which shows the first few and last few
  elements when truncating, and `"head"`, which shows only the first few
  elements.

- ...:

  Arguments collapsed and interpolated into a condition message.

- class:

  A character vector of classes for the condition.

- call:

  Environment of the call to associate with the error condition,
  defaults to the caller's environment.

- .envir:

  The environment in which to evaluate the `...` expressions, defaults
  to the parent frame.

- arg:

  Argument to check.

- x:

  A ts_caller_arg object.

- n:

  Number of frames to go up to find the caller environment.

- frame:

  Frame number to inspect, defaults to the caller's frame.

- tree:

  A `ts_tree` object as returned by
  [`ts_tree_new()`](https://r-lib.github.io/tsitter/dev/reference/ts_tree_new.md).

- text:

  Raw vector, the original text used to parse the tree.

## Value

`ts_collapse()` returns a character scalar, the collapsed string.

`ts_cnd()` returns an error condition object.

`ts_caller_arg()` returns the captured expression as a ts_caller_arg
object.

`as_ts_caller_arg()` returns a ts_caller_arg object.

`as.character.ts_caller_arg()` returns a short string representation of
the caller argument, a character scalar.

`ts_caller_env()` returns an environment, or `NULL` is called from the
global environment.

`ts_check_named_arg()` returns `TRUE` invisibly if the argument was
named, otherwise it raises an error.

`ts_parse_error_cnd()` returns a ts_parse_error condition

## Details

`ts_collapse()` collapses a character vector into a single string, with
options for truncation by number of elements or display width. It is
useful for creating informative error messages.

`ts_cnd()` creates a condition object. It interpolates its arguments
into a single message.

`ts_caller_arg()` captures the expression used as an argument to a
function, for use in error messages.

`as_ts_caller_arg()` converts an object into a caller argument object.
This is useful when referring to parts of the caller argument in
downstream error messages.

`as.character.ts_caller_arg()` formats a caller argument object as a
short string for use in error messages. Multi-line expressions are
truncated after the first line.

`ts_caller_env()` returns the environment of the caller function, `n`
levels up the call stack. This is useful for associating error
conditions with the correct call.

`ts_check_named_arg()` checks whether an argument was supplied with a
name. If not, it raises an error.

`ts_parse_error_cnd()` creates a parse error condition associated with a
`ts_tree` object and the original text. The error message includes
information about the location of parse errors in the text. It also has
[`format()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/format.html) and
[`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html) methods to display the
error together with the relevant lines of the original text.

## Examples

``` r
ts_collapse(letters[1:3])
#> [1] "a, b, and c"
ts_collapse(letters[1:10], trunc = 5)
#> [1] "a, b, c, ..., i, and j"
```
